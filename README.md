# sling-jbake
Experimenting with JBake for the Apache Sling website.

TODO does commit to github work?

See also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-6955

## How to build the site locally  
Clone this repository, run the below Maven command, http://localhost:8820/ and enjoy.

    mvn clean package jbake:inline -Djbake.port=8820 -Djbake.listenAddress=0.0.0.0

## How to publish the website
Build the site using `mvn clean package` and then sync the `target/sling-site-*` folder to the `asf-site` branch
of this Git repository, commit and push that branch.

The ASF's gitpubsub mechanism then synchronizes that content
on the http://sling.apache.org website, usually within a few seconds.

## TODO

### apache.org requirements
* Activate all the required links checked by https://whimsy.apache.org/site/

### Nice to have
* JBake 2.5.x does not support the `[TOC]` macro but apparently that will be available once JBake moves to https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java , probably in its next version as per [#376](https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/pull/376). We might wait for that and just mark the TOCs as unsupported for now.
* The "last changed by" information at the bottom right side of pages is missing, it was quite useful. The format is like `Rev. 1692085 by rombert on Tue, 21 Jul 2015 11:04:15 +0000`

### Final validation, activation etc.
* Review all pages
* Resync the content with the current Sling website if needed, initially synced at r1798604 and later (September 26th, 2017) resynced to svn revision 1809724

### Done
* Fix internal links like `refs.project-information.path` 
* Page header and footer, logo etc
* Remove unused assets files and templates (copied from JBake Groovy sample)
* Tables work now, needed the pegdown TABLES extension
* Move images and other files to /assets and convert their links
* Fix references like `refs.authentication-tasks.headers.excerpt` as well as `.title` references -> replace with copies of those titles and excerpts, or use tags to mark and select
* Fix remaining `refs.` links -> those are probably broken anyway
* Test the downloads.cgi page, requires an apache.org setup (INFRA-14390) -> done at https://sling.apache.org/ng/downloads.cgi
* Fix broken tables: the current pegdown parser has troubles with table cells containing special characters, tables containing a single dash for example need to be converted to `(-)` as a workaround.
* Enumerate child pages in documentation/tutorials-how-tos.html and smilar pages -> replaced with a manually generated list.
* Sitemap page
* Left menu layout is now correct
* Breadcrumbs are back.
* The `#!xml` and `#!java` code higlighting macros are not supported, for now they are replaced by HTML comments.

## JBake and other technotes
* Currently using 2.5.1, see under `/bin`, docs at http://jbake.org/docs/2.5.1
* Uses https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown for Markdown, syntax info at https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/blob/master/src/test/resources/MarkdownTest103/Markdown%20Documentation%20-%20Syntax.md , extensions at http://www.decodified.com/pegdown/api/org/pegdown/Extensions.html
* Groovy MarkupTemplateEngine examples at https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-example-project-groovy-mt , docs for that engine at http://groovy-lang.org/templating.html#_simpletemplateengine
* Other Apache projects using JBake include at least Tamaya (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tamaya-site) and OpenNLP (https://github.com/apache/opennlp-site) and the Incubator is apparently also switching to it.

##Â Useful scripts and commands
To find broken links use 

    wget --spider -r -nd -nv -l 5 http://localhost:8820/ 2>&1 | grep -B1 'broken link'

To find leftover `refs.` in pages use

    wget -r -nv -l 5 http://localhost:8820/
    find localhost\:8820/ -type f | xargs grep -l 'refs\.'

To diff the generated HTML, ignoring housekeeping stuff use

    git diff -U0 | grep -v lastmod | grep -v '^---' | grep -v '^+++' | grep -v '^diff' | grep -v '^index' | grep -v '@@'
