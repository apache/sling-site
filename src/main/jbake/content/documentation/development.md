Welcome to the wonderful world of extending Sling. Refer to these pages to find out how we envision the extension of Sling and how to do it.

See also [Developing for Sling](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SLING/Developing+for+Sling) on the Sling Wiki,
which has more information on specific topics.

## Maven Stuff

Sling is using Apache Maven 3 as its build system. Over time we have created a number of Maven 3 plugins and gathered a whole range of knowledge about using Maven.

* [Sling Maven Plugin](http://sling.apache.org/components/sling-maven-plugin/)
* [HTL Maven Plugin](http://sling.apache.org/components/htl-maven-plugin/)
* [SlingStart Maven Plugin](http://sling.apache.org/components/slingstart-maven-plugin/)

* [Maven Archetypes](/documentation/development/maven-archetypes.html)
* [Maven Tips & Tricks](/documentation/development/maventipsandtricks.html)


## Sling Development

Last but not least, here is some more information on how we ourselves are working on Sling

* [Dependency Management](/documentation/development/dependency-management.html)
* [Version Policy](/documentation/development/version-policy.html)
* [Issue Tracker](/documentation/development/issue-tracker.html)
* [Release Management](/documentation/development/release-management.html)
* [Deprecating Sling Modules](/documentation/development/deprecating-sling-modules.html)
* [Maven Usage](/documentation/development/maven-usage.html)
* [Build Setup](/project-information.html#continuous-integration) 
* To run our integration tests suite see the [Sling Starter module README](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-starter/blob/master/README.md) and the [launchpad/integration-tests README](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-launchpad-integration-tests/blob/master/README.md) for how to run individual integration tests. We use the [sling-IT](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20sling-IT) label in JIRA for known issues with our integration tests.
