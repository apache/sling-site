## Servlet Resolving

First of all Sling looks up the resource identified by the URL - typically a path inside the JCR repository, which is annotated by the `sling:resourceType` property 
which defines the resource type of that resource. Using this resource type (which is usually a relative resource path, 
eg. "myblog/comment"), servlets (or scripts) are looked up. For more details about how the initial resource is identified for a specific request URL look at [URL decomposition](/documentation/the-sling-engine/url-decomposition.html).

Servlets and scripts are themselves resources in Sling and thus have a resource path: this is either the location in the 
resource repository, the resource type in a servlet component configuration or the "virtual" bundle resource path 
(if a script is provided inside a bundle without being installed into the JCR repository). 

For details on which script/servlet is selected in case there are multiple candidates refer to the sections below.


## Servlet Registration

Servlets can be registered as OSGi services. The following service reference properties are evaluated for Servlets defined as OSGi services of type `javax.servlet.Servlet` (all those property names are defined in `org.apache.sling.api.servlets.ServletResolverConstants` (since API 2.15.2) or `org.apache.sling.servlets.resolver.internal.ServletResolverConstants` (before API 2.15.2):

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sling.servlet.resourceTypes` | The resource type(s) supported by the servlet. The property value must either be a single String, an array of Strings or a Vector of Strings. Either this property or the `sling.servlet.paths` property must be set, or the servlet is ignored. If both are set, the servlet is registered using both ways. |
| `sling.servlet.resourceSuperType` | The resource super type, indicating which previously registered servlet could intercept the request if the request matches the resource super type better. The property value must be a single String. This property is only considered for the registration with `sling.servlet.resourceTypes`. (since version `2.3.0` of the `org.apache.sling.api.servlets` API, version `2.5.2` of the `org.apache.sling.servlets.resolver` bundle)|
| `sling.servlet.selectors` | The request URL selectors supported by the servlet. The selectors must be configured as they would be specified in the URL that is as a list of dot-separated strings such as <em>print.a4</em>. In case this is not empty the first selector(s) (i.e. the one(s) on the left) in the request URL must match, otherwise the servlet is not executed. After that may follow arbitrarily many non-registered selectors. The property value must either be a single String, an array of Strings or a Vector of Strings. This property is only considered for the registration with `sling.servlet.resourceTypes`. |
| `sling.servlet.extensions` | The request URL extensions supported by the servlet for requests. The property value must either be a single String, an array of Strings or a Vector of Strings. This property is only considered for the registration with `sling.servlet.resourceTypes`. |
| `sling.servlet.methods` | The request methods supported by the servlet. The property value must either be a single String, an array of Strings or a Vector of Strings. This property is only considered for the registration with `sling.servlet.resourceTypes`. If this property is missing, the value defaults to GET and HEAD, regardless of which methods are actually implemented/handled by the servlet. A value of `*` leads to a servlet being bound to all methods. |
| `sling.servlet.paths` | A list of absolute paths under which the servlet is accessible as a Resource. The property value must either be a single String, an array of Strings or a Vector of Strings.<br>A servlet using this property might be ignored unless its path is included in the *Execution Paths* (`servletresolver.paths`) configuration setting of the `SlingServletResolver` service. Either this property or the `sling.servlet.resourceTypes` property must be set, or the servlet is ignored. If both are set, the servlet is registered using both ways.<br>Binding resources by paths is discouraged, see [caveats when binding servlets by path](#caveats-when-binding-servlets-by-path) below. |
| `sling.servlet.paths.strict` | When set to `true`, this enables _strict_ selection mode for servlets bound by path. In this mode, the above `.extensions`, `.selectors` and `.methods` service properties are taken into account to select such servlets. <br> If this property is not set to `true` the behavior is unchanged from previous versions and only the `.paths` property is considered when selecting such servlets. <br>The special value `.EMPTY.` can be used for the `.selectors` and `.extensions` properties to require the corresponding request values to be empty for the servlet to be selected. <br>See the [ServletSelectionIT](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-servlets-resolver/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/it/ServletSelectionIT.java) test for details. <br> These features require version 2.6.6 or later of the `org.apache.sling.servlets.resolver` module.<br>Binding resources by paths is discouraged, see [caveats when binding servlets by path](#caveats-when-binding-servlets-by-path) below. |
| `sling.servlet.prefix` | The prefix or numeric index to make relative paths absolute. If the value of this property is a number (int), it defines the index of the search path entries from the resource resolver to be used as the prefix. The defined search path is used as a prefix to mount this servlet. The number can be -1 which always points to the last search entry. If the specified value is higher than than the highest index of the search paths, the last entry is used. The index starts with 0. If the value of this property is a string and parseable as a number, the value is treated as if it would be a number. If the value of this property is a string starting with "/", this value is applied as a prefix, regardless of the configured search paths! If the value is anything else, it is ignored. If this property is not specified, it defaults to the default configuration of the sling servlet resolver. |
| `sling.core.servletName` | The name with which the servlet should be registered. This registration property is optional. If one is not explicitly set, the servlet's name will be determined from either the property `component.name`, `service.pid` or `service.id` (in that order). This means that the name is always set (as at least the last property is always ensured by OSGi).

For a Servlet registered as an OSGi service to be used by the Sling Servlet Resolver, either one or both of the `sling.servlet.paths` or the `sling.servlet.resourceTypes` service reference properties must be set. If neither is set, the Servlet service is ignored.

Each path to be used for registration - either from the `sling.servlet.paths` property or constructed from the other `sling.servlet.*` properties - must be absolute. Any relative path is made absolute by prefixing it with a root path. This prefix may be set with the `sling.servlet.prefix` service registration property. If this property is not set, the first entry in the `ResourceResolver` search path for the `ResourceResolver.getResource(String)` method is used as the prefix. If this entry cannot be derived, a simpe slash - `/` \- is used as the prefix.

If `sling.servlet.methods` is not specified, the servlet is only registered for handling GET and HEAD requests. Make sure to list all methods you want to be handled by this servlet.

### Servlet Resource Provider

A `ServletMounter` listens for `javax.servlet.Servlet` services. This only applies to OSGi services implementing `javax.servlet.Servlet`. Each individual servlet will have a dedicated service instance of `ServletResourceProvider` associated to it, which will provide `ServletResources` in the resource tree, based on the servlet's registration properties. The actual resource path of such resources differs for servlets registered by type and those registered by path:

| Servlet registered by | Full Resource Path |
| --- | --- |
| Path | `<given path>.servlet`
| ResourceType | for each selector, extension and method combination one resource with path  `<resource type>[/[<selector with separator '/'>.][<extension>][<method>]].servlet'`.

If multiple servlets are registered for the same metadata the one with the highest service ranking is returned in the virtual resource tree. The resources expose the following properties:

| Property Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sling:resourceType` | the resource type to which the servlet is registered. Is equal to the absolute resource path. |
| `sling:resourceSuperType` | the resource super type. Is `sling/bundle/resource` if not explicitly set. |
| `servletName` | the name of the servlet |
| `servletClass` | the fully-qualified class name of the underlying servlet |

In addition each such resource can be adapted to a `Servlet`.

### Caveats when binding servlets by path

Binding servlets by paths has several disadvantages when compared to binding by resource types, namely:

* path-bound servlets cannot be access controlled using the default JCR repository ACLs
* path-bound servlets can only be registered to a path and not a resource type (i.e. no suffix handling)
* if a path-bound servlet is not active, e.g. if the bundle is missing or not started, a POST might result in unexpected results. usually creating a node at /bin/xyz which subsequently overlays the servlets path binding
* the mapping is not transparent to a developer looking just at the repository

Given these drawbacks it is strongly recommended to bind servlets to resource types rather than paths. 

The `sling.servlet.paths.strict` mode described on this page slightly improves things by enabling a stricter
selection of path-bound servlets, but that's only minor improvements.

### Registering a Servlet using Java Annotations

The "new" (as of 2018) Sling Servlet annotations were presented by Konrad Windszus at [adaptTo() 2018](https://adapt.to/2018/en/schedule/lightning-talks/new-sling-servlet-annotations.html).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CBjnQnrxTw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you are working with the default Apache Sling development stack you can either use 

* [OSGi DS 1.4 (R7) component property type annotations](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-servlets-annotations) (introduced with DS 1.4/OSGi R7, supported since [bnd 4.1](https://github.com/bndtools/bndtools/wiki/Changes-in-4.1.0) being used in [bnd-maven-plugin 4.1.0+](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/tree/master/maven/bnd-maven-plugin) and `maven-bundle-plugin 4.1.0+`),
* [OSGi DS annotations](https://osgi.org/javadoc/r6/cmpn/org/osgi/service/component/annotations/package-summary.html) (introduced with DS 1.2/OSGi R5, properly supported since [bnd 3.0](https://github.com/bndtools/bndtools/wiki/Changes-in-3.0.0), being used in [maven-bundle-plugin 3.0.0](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html)) or 
* Generic Felix SCR or Sling-specific `@SlingServlet` annotations from [Apache Felix Maven SCR Plugin](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-scr-plugin.html) to register your Sling servlets:

The following examples show example code how you can register Servlets with Sling

1. OSGi DS 1.4 (R7) component property type annotations for Sling Servlets (recommended)

        ::java
        @Component(service = { Servlet.class })
        @SlingServletResourceTypes(
            resourceTypes="/apps/my/type", 
            methods= "GET",
            extensions="html",
            selectors="hello")
        public class MyServlet extends SlingSafeMethodsServlet {

            @Override
            protected void doGet(SlingHttpServletRequest request, SlingHttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                ...
            }
        }

    This is only supported though if you use either the `bnd-maven-plugin` or the `maven-bundle-plugin` in version 4.0.0 or newer and use Sling which is at least compliant with OSGi R6 (DS 1.3). There is no actual run-time dependency to OSGi R7! The configuration for the `bnd-maven-plugin` should look like this in your `pom.xml`
    
        ::xml
        <build>
          ...
          <plugins>
            <plugin>
              <groupId>biz.aQute.bnd</groupId>
              <artifactId>bnd-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>4.0.0</version>
              <executions>
                <execution>
                  <goals>
                    <goal>bnd-process</goal>
                  </goals>
                </execution>
              </executions>
            </plugin>
            ...
          </plugins>
          ...
        </build>
        ...
        <dependencies>
          ...
          <!-- dependency towards the custom component property type annotations for Sling Servlets -->
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.sling</groupId>
            <artifactId>org.apache.sling.servlets.annotations</artifactId>
            <version>1.2.4</version>
          </dependency>
          ...
        </dependencies>
    
    Please refer to the [Javadoc of the package](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-servlets-annotations/tree/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/annotations) for other related annotations.

    Starting with version `1.2.4` of the `org.apache.sling.servlets.annotations` you can also generate a value for the `sling.servlet.resourceSuperType` registration property, by using the `resourceSuperType` annotation property (its default value is `sling/bundle/resource`). In order for the property to be taken into consideration, your Sling instance has to provide version `2.5.2` or newer of the `org.apache.sling.servlets.resolver` bundle.  
            
1. Simple OSGi DS 1.2 annotations (use only if you cannot use approach 1.)

        ::java
        @Component(
        service = { Servlet.class },
        property = { 
            SLING_SERVLET_RESOURCE_TYPES + "=/apps/my/type"
            SLING_SERVLET_METHODS + "=GET",
            SLING_SERVLET_EXTENSIONS + "=html",
            SLING_SERVLET_SELECTORS + "=hello",
          }
        )
        public class MyServlet extends SlingSafeMethodsServlet {

            @Override
            protected void doGet(SlingHttpServletRequest request, SlingHttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                ...
            }
        }

2. The `@SlingServlet` annotation (evaluated by maven-scr-plugin, use only if you can neither use 1. nor 2.)

        ::java
        @SlingServlet(
            resourceTypes = "/apps/my/type",
            selectors = "hello",
            extensions = "html",
            methods = "GET")
        public class MyServlet extends SlingSafeMethodsServlet {

            @Override
            protected void doGet(SlingHttpServletRequest request, SlingHttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                ...
            }
        }

### Automated tests

The [launchpad/test-services](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-launchpad-test-services) module contains test servlets that use various combinations of the above properties.

The [launchpad/integration-tests](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-launchpad-integration-tests) module contains a number of tests (like the [ExtensionServletTest|https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-launchpad-integration-tests/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sling/launchpad/webapp/integrationtest/servlets/resolution/ExtensionServletTest.java] for example) that verify the results.

The [sling-org-apache-sling-servlets-resolver](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-servlets-resolver) module also has some tests which
provide more specific information about these mechanisms.

Such tests run as part of our continuous integration process, to demonstrate and verify the behavior of the various servlet registration mechanisms, in a way that's guaranteed to be in sync with the actual Sling core code. If you have an idea for additional tests, patches are welcome!


### Example: Registration by Path

The `sling.servlet.paths.strict` mode described in the next example is preferred over this older
way of mounting servlets by path, where a Servlet service with these properties:

    sling.servlet.paths = [ "/libs/sling/sample/html", "/libs/sling/sample/txt" ]

Is registered under the indicated paths, without requiring Resources to be present
under those paths.

Other `sling.servlet.*` service properties such are ignored in this mode. To take
them into account, use the `sling.servlet.paths.strict` mode described in the
next example.

See also the [caveats when binding servlets by path](#caveats-when-binding-servlets-by-path) .

### Example: Registration by Path, strict mode

This strict mode was added in version 2.6.6 of the `org.apache.sling.servlets.resolver` module and is preferred
over the old mode where just the path is taken into account for path-mounted servlets.

    sling.servlet.paths = [ "/libs/sling/sample/html", "/libs/sling/sample/txt" ]
    sling.servlet.paths.strict = true
    sling.servlet.selectors = [ ".EMPTY." ]
    sling.servlet.extensions = [ "html", "txt", "json" ]
    sling.servlet.methods = [ "GET" ]

The `sling.servlet.paths.strict` property has been added to allow stricter criteria for selecting
path-mounted servlets.

In the above example, the servlet is mounted on the indicated paths, but only if the request has one
of the indicated extensions, uses the GET method and has no selectors. See the above documentation
of the `sling.servlet.paths.strict` property for more information, and see also the
[caveats when binding servlets by path](#caveats-when-binding-servlets-by-path) .

### Example: Registration by Resource Type etc.


    sling.servlet.resourceTypes = [ "sling/unused" ]
    sling.servlet.selectors = [ "img", "tab" ]
    sling.servlet.extensions = [ "html", "txt", "json" ]

A Servlet service registered with these properties is registered for the following resource types:

* `<prefix>/sling/unused/img/html`
* `<prefix>/sling/unused/img/txt`
* `<prefix>/sling/unused/img/json`
* `<prefix>/sling/unused/tab/html`
* `<prefix>/sling/unused/tab/txt`
* `<prefix>/sling/unused/tab/json`

As explained the Servlet is registered for each permutation of the resource types, selectors and extension. See above at the explanation of `sling.servlet.prefix` how `<prefix>` is defined.

It is more common to register for absolute resource types or at least explicitly define `sling.servlet.prefix` as well, because otherwise you are in most cases not sure under which absolute path the Servlet is registered (and therefore by which
other paths it might get overwritten).

### Servlet Lifecycle Issues

The Servlet API specification states the following with respect to the life
cycle of Servlets:

>  The servlet container calls the init method exactly once after
>  instantiating the servlet.

This works perfectly in a regular servlet container which both instantiates
and initializes the servlets. With Sling the tasks of instantiation and
initialization are split:

* The provider of the Servlet service takes care of creating the servlet instance
* The Sling Servlet Resolver picks up the Servlet services and initializes and destroys them as needed

So Sling has not way of making sure a Servlet is only initialized and destroyed
once in the life time of the Servlet object instance.

The provider of the Servlet service on the other can cope with this
situation by making sure to drop the servlet instance once it is destroyed.
The mechanism helping the provider here is the OSGi Service Factory.


## Default Servlet(s)

As explained in the Resolution Process section above, a default Servlet is selected if no servlet (or script) for the current resource type can be found. To make the provisioning of a default Servlet as versatile as provisioning per resource type Servlets (or scripts), the default Servlet is selected with just a special resource type `sling/servlet/default`.

The actual Servlet or Script called as the default Servlet is resolved exactly the same way as for any resource type. That is, also for the default Servlet selection, the request selectors and extension or method are considered. Also, the Servlet may be a Servlet registered as an OSGi service or it may be a Script stored in the repository or provided by any bundle.

Finally, if not even a registered default Servlet may be resolved for the request, because none has been registered, the `servlets/resolver` bundle provides a fall back the `DefaultServlet` with the following functionality:

* If an `NonExistingResource` was created for the request the `DefaultServlet` sends a 404 (Not Found)
* Otherwise the `DefaultServlet` sends a 500 (Internal Server Error), because normally at least a `NonExistingResource` should be created

## Scripts

Scripts are internally handled like servlet, details are described in [Sling Scripting](/documentation/bundles/scripting.html).

## OptingServlet interface

If a registered servlet implements the OptingServlet interface, Sling uses that servlet's `accepts(SlingHttpServletRequest request)` method to refine the servlet resolution process.

In this case, the servlet is only selected for processing the current request if its `accept` method returns true.

While an opting servlet seems to be a nice way of picking the right servlet to process the request, the use of an opting servlet is not recommended: the main reason is that it complicates the request processing, makes it less transparent what is going on during a request and prevents optimizations like caching the script resolution in an optimal manner. The other static options are usually sufficient for all use cases.

## Servlet Resolution Order

The following order rules are being followed when trying to resolve a servlet for a given request URL and request method and multiple candidates would match. Then the following candidate is being picked (if one rule doesn't lead to one winner, the next rule is being evaluated):

1. The one with the highest number of matching selectors + extension
2. The one which is registered to a resource type closest to the requested one (when traversing the resource type hierarchy up), refer to section [Resource Type Inheritance](#resource-type-inheritance) for more details
3. The one with the highest service ranking according to [OSGi Core 8 Chapter 5.2.6](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.service.html#framework.service.servicerankingorder)

In case of an `OptingServlet` not matching the next candidate is being used.

### Resource Type Inheritance 

Resource type inheritance as implemented for [SLING-278](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-278) plays a vital role in servlet resolution. 

Each resource type may have a resource super type, which may be defined in various ways. One example is having a `sling:resourceSuperType` property in the resource addressed by the resource type. See [http://www.mail-archive.com/sling-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg02365.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/sling-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg02365.html) and [SLING-278](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-278) for more details. Also the servlet (or script) itself may define a resource super type (which is only used in case the request resource does not define one).

If a resource type has no explicit resource super type, the resource super type is assumed to be `sling/servlet/default`. That is the resource type used for default script selection is also acting as a basic resource type much like `java.lang.Object` does for other types in the Java language. 


## Error Handler Servlet(s) or Scripts

Error handling support is described on the [Errorhandling](/documentation/the-sling-engine/errorhandling.html) page.
