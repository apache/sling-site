The OSGi Feature Model, created in 2018, is meant to replace the Sling Provisioning Model as the primary way of defining and assembling Sling applications.

Compared to the Provisioning Model, the Feature Model is richer and more general, and might evolve into an OSGi
standard. It has been created in Sling as that's its primary audience for now, but might move elsewhere as it
evolves.

See [https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-feature](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-feature) for more information
about the Feature Model.
