Sling includes four Maven archetypes to quick start development. See [http://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/](http://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/) for general information on using Maven archetypes. The Maven groupId for all Sling archetypes is `org.apache.sling`.

### sling-launchpad-standalone-archetype

This archetype generates a Maven project which will build a standalone Launchpad JAR file using the default bundle set. For demonstration purposes, the generated project includes an extra bundle list file (`src/main/bundles/list`) which includes Apache Felix FileInstall as well as a test configuration file (`src/test/config/sling.properties`).

### sling-launchpad-webapp-archetype

This archetype generates a Maven project which will build a Launchpad WAR file using the default bundle set. For demonstration purposes, the generated project includes an extra bundle list file (`src/main/bundles/list`) which includes Apache Felix FileInstall as well as a test configuration file (`src/test/config/sling.properties`).

### sling-initial-content-archetype

This archetype generates a Maven project which will build an OSGi bundle that supports JCR NodeType registration (in `SLING-INF/nodetypes/nodetypes.cnd`) and initial content loading (in `SLING-INF/scripts` and `SLING-INF/content`).

### sling-servlet-archetype

This archetype generates a Maven project which will build an OSGi bundle containing two Servlets registered with Sling, one registered by path and one registered by resource type.

### sling-bundle-archetype

This archetype generates a Maven project which will build a basic OSGi bundle including support for the Felix SCR Annotations. It is pre-configured to install using the Felix Web Console when the profile `autoInstallBundle` is activated.


### sling-jcrinstall-bundle-archetype

This archetype generates a Maven project which will build a basic OSGi bundle including support for the Felix SCR Annotations. It is pre-configured to install using a WebDAV PUT into the JCR when the profile `autoInstallBundle` is activated.
