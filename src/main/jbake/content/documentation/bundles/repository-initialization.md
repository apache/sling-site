~~~~~~

The `SlingRepositoryInitializer` mechanism (short: repoinit) allows for running code before the `SlingRepository` service is registered. This is useful for initialization and content migration purposes.

Starting with version 1.1.40 of the bundle `org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit` repoinit scripts are safely executed also in environments with a shared repository; this is implemented by a retry-mechanism with randomized delays.

## SlingRepositoryInitializer
The `SlingRepositoryInitializer` is a very simple service interface, available from version 2.4.0 of the `org.apache.sling.jcr.api` and `org.apache.sling.jcr.base` bundles.

	public interface SlingRepositoryInitializer {
	    public void processRepository(SlingRepository repo) throws Exception;
	}
	
Services that implement this interface are called when setting up the JCR-based `SlingRepository` service, before registering it as an OSGi service.

They are called in increasing order of their `service.ranking` service property, which needs to be an `Integer` as usual.

If any of them throws an Exception, the `SlingRepository` service is not registered.
    
## The 'repoinit' Repository Initialization Language
The `org.apache.sling.repoinit.parser` implements a mini-language meant to create paths, service users and manage access control in a content repository, as 
well as registering JCR namespaces, node types and privileges. Defining access control content consists of setting and 
deleting policies of type access control lists (ACL) for which individual access control entries (ACE) can be added and removed.

The source code consists of [two modules](https://github.com/apache?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sling+repoinit): the parser and the JCR 
repoinit adapter module.

The language grammar is defined (using the JavaCC compiler-compiler, which has no runtime dependencies) in the `RepoInitGrammar.jjt` file in that module, and the automated tests provide a number of [test cases](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-repoinit-parser/tree/master/src/test/resources/testcases) which demonstrate various features.

The companion `org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit` module implements those operations on an Oak JCR repository, using a `SlingRepositoryInitializer`
registered by default with a service ranking of 100. It also provides a `JcrRepoInitOpsProcessor` service to explicitly apply the output
of the repoinit parser to a JCR repository.

The language is mostly self-explaining, the test suite listed below in Appendix A exposes
all language constructs and options.

A [jbang script in the Sling whiteboard repository](https://github.com/apache/sling-whiteboard/blob/master/jbang/RepoinitValidator.java) can be used to test the syntax of repoinit statements by
running a specific version of the repoinit parser on them.

### Notes on Repository Initializer Config Files

If the Repository Initializer is defined inside a **.config** file then according to the .config file
definition found [here](/documentation/bundles/configuration-installer-factory.html#configuration-files-config)
these rules apply:

* Quotes that start / end a String literal need to be escaped with a backslash like this: **\\\"**
* Quotes inside a String literal need to be escapped with a double backslash like this: **\\\\\"**
* Equals Sign inside a String need to be escaped with a backslash like this: **\\=**

## Providing repoinit statements from the Sling provisioning model or other URLs

All bundles required for this feature need to be active before the `SlingRepository` service starts.

From version 1.0.2 of the `org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit` bundle, the `o.a.s.jcr.repoinit.RepositoryInitializer` component uses an OSGi 
configuration as shown in this example to define where to read repoinit statements:

<pre class="language-no-highlight">
  org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit.impl.RepositoryInitializer
    references=["model:context:/resources/provisioning/model.txt","model@repoinitTwo:context:/resources/provisioning/model.txt"]
</pre>
    
This example defines two _references_ to URLs that supply repoinit statements. Their syntax is described below.

By default the `RepositoryInitializer` uses the first URL shown in the above example, which points to the provisioning model that's embedded by default in the Sling Launchpad runnable jar.

Note that previous versions of the `org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit` bundle used different configuration parameters. From version 1.0.2 on, warnings are logged if those old parameters (_text.url,text.format,model.section.name_) are used.

### References to Sling Provisioning Model additional sections
The `slingstart-maven-plugin`, from V1.4.2 on, allows for embedding so-called "additional sections" in the Sling provisioning model by starting
their name with a colon.

At runtime this requires the `org.apache.sling.provisioning.model` bundle, version 1.4.2 or later.

The `o.a.s.jcr.repoinit` bundle can use this feature to execute `repoinit` statements provided by Sling provisioning models, as in this 
provisioning model example fragment:

<pre class="language-no-highlight">
  [:repoinit]
  create path /repoinit/provisioningModelTest

  create service user provisioningModelUser
</pre>
	
To read repoinit statements from such an additional provisioning model section, the `RepositoryInitializer` configuration shown above uses references like

<pre class="language-no-highlight">
  model@repoinitTwo:context:/resources/provisioning/model.txt
</pre>
	
Where _model_ means "use the provisioning model format", _repoinitTwo_ is the name of the additional section to read statements from in the provisioning 
model (without the leading colon) and _context:/resources/..._ is the URL to use to retrieve the provisioning model.

In this example the URL uses the _context_ scheme defined by the Sling Launchpad, but any scheme can be used provided a suitable URL handler is active.

The section name in that reference is optional and defaults to _repoinit_. If it's not specified the `@` should be omitted as well.
	
### References to URLs providing raw repoinit statements
Using a `RepositoryInitializer` reference like in this example, with the _raw_ prefix, means that its content is passed as is to the repoinit parser:

<pre class="language-no-highlight">
  raw:classpath://some-repoinit-file.txt
</pre>
	
Which points to a `classpath:` URL to provide the raw repoinit statements in this example, but again any valid URL scheme can be used.

## Providing repoinit statements from OSGi factory configurations

From version 1.1.6 of the `org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit` bundle, repoinit statements can also be provided by OSGi factory
configurations which use the `org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit.RepositoryInitializer` factory PID.

Such configurations have two optional fields:

  * A multi-value `references` field with each value providing the URL (as a String) of raw repoinit statements.
  * A multi-value `scripts` field with each value providing repoinit statements as plain text in a String.

## Appendix A: repoinit syntax: parser test scenarios
A concatenation of all test scenarios from the
[repoinit parser module](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-repoinit-parser/tree/master/src/test/resources/testcases)
follows.

Assuming that test suite is complete, this exposes all the language constructs
and options, with descriptive comments where needed. If something's unclear, please
ask or provide patches for these tests to make them easier to understand.

The following output is generated by the [concatenate-test-scenarios.sh](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-repoinit-parser/tree/master/concatenate-test-scenarios.sh) script found in the
repoinit parser repository.
