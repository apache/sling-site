The `jackrabbit-accessmanager` bundle delivers a REST interface to manipulate users permissions in the JCR. After installing the `jackrabbit-accessmanager` bundle the REST services are exposed under the path of the node where you will manipulate the permissions for a user with a specific selector like `modifyAce`, `acl`, `eacl` and `deleteAce`.

## Add or modify permissions

To modify the permissions for a node POST a request to `/<path-to-the-node>.modifyAce.<html or json>`. The following parameters are available:

Name | Since | Description
--- | --- | ---
`principalId` | | The id of the user or group to modify the access rights for
`order` | | The position of the entry within the list (see below for details)
`privilege@[privilege_name]` | | One param for each privilege to modify.  The value must be either 'allow', 'deny' or 'none'.  For backward compatibility, 'granted' or 'denied' are accepted as aliases for 'allow' or 'deny'.
`restriction@[restriction_name]` | 3.0.4 | One param for each restriction value.  The same parameter name may be used again for multi-value restrictions.  The value is the target value of the restriction.
`restriction@[restriction_name]@Delete` | 3.0.4 | One param for each restriction to delete.  The parameter value is ignored and can be anything.
`privilege@[privilege_name]@Delete` | 3.1.0 | One param for each privilege to delete. The parameter value must be either 'allow', 'deny' or 'all' to specify which state to delete from.
`restriction@[privilege_name]@[restriction_name]@Allow` | 3.1.0 | One param for each restriction value to apply to the 'allow' privilege. The same parameter name may be used again for multi-value restrictions. The value is the target value of the restriction to be set.
`restriction@[privilege_name]@[restriction_name]@Deny` | 3.1.0 | One param for each restriction value to apply to the 'deny' privilege. The same parameter name may be used again for multi-value restrictions. The value is the target value of the restriction to be set.
`restriction@[privilege_name]@[restriction_name]@Delete` | 3.1.0 | One param for each restriction to delete. The parameter value must be either 'allow', 'deny' or 'all' to specify which state to delete from.

The `order` parameter may have the following values:

 Value | Description
--- | ---
`first` | Place the target entry as the first amongst its siblings
`last` | Place the target entry as the last amongst its siblings
`before *xyz*` | Place the target entry immediately before the sibling whose name is *xyz*
`after *xyz*` | Place the target entry immediately after the sibling whose name is *xyz*
numeric | Place the target entry at the indicated numeric place amongst its siblings where *0* is equivalent to `first` and *1* means the second place

#### Parameters Conflict Resolution
*since version 3.1.0 for [SLING-11243](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-11243)*

The request parameters may be ambiguous or create a conflict.  Below is the steps that are taken to resolve conflicts:

1. The already existing ACE state is loaded from the repository (if any).
2. All `privilege@[privilege_name]@Delete` parameters (if any) are processed to remove the specified privileges.
3. All `restriction@[restriction_name]@Delete` and `restriction@[privilege_name]@[restriction_name]@Delete` parameters (if any) are processed to remove the specified restrictions that still exist.
4. All `privilege@[privilege_name]` parameters (if any) are processed to allow, deny or remove the privilege based on the parameter value.  When there are multiple applicable parameters, they are sorted before processing based on the longest privilege depth.  For example, privilege "rep:addProperties" (depth=4) would be processed after "jcr:modifyProperties" (depth=3) as it is considered more specific.
5. All `restriction@[privilege_name]@[restriction_name]@[Allow|Deny]` parameters (if any) are processed to update the restriction for the allow or deny privilege based on the parameter value. When there are multiple applicable parameters, they are sorted before processing based on the longest depth of the privilege.  For example, privilege "rep:addProperties" (depth=4) would be processed after "jcr:modifyProperties" (depth=3) as it is considered more specific.  Also if the allow and deny restriction for a privilege have identical values, then the allow restriction wins and the deny restriction is discarded.
6. For any privileges remaining in the set, consolidate any aggregates that have all their contained privileges set.  For example, if "rep:readNodes" and "rep:readProperties" are both set with the same restrictions, then a "jcr:read" privilege will replace those two.

## Migration from 3.x version
*since version 3.1.0 for [SLING-11233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-11233)*

In the previous versions, the restriction details in the ACL json output could be ambiguous in some situations.  For [SLING-11233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-11233) the 
JSON output structure was changed. The previous "granted/denied/restrictions" items in each ACE were replaced with a "privileges" structure whose items are the allow or deny privileges.  Each privilege now has a "deny" and/or "allow" child whose value is either true (no restrictions) or an array of restrictions + values.

Any code that was expecting the previous JSON structure will need to be adjusted to compensate for the new structure.

For example:

    {
      "user1":{
        "principal":"user1",
        "order":0,
        "privileges":{
          "jcr:read":{
            "allow":{
              "rep:glob":"glob1"
            }
          },
          "jcr:readAccessControl":{
            "allow":{
              "rep:itemNames":[
                "name1",
                "name2"
              ]
            }
          },
          "rep:write":{
            "deny":true
          }
        }
      }
    }
