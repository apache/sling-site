# Introduction
**This documentation only applies to versions >= 1.2 (due to major changes done in [SLING-3423](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3423))**

The Resource Merger bundle provides two resource provider factories

* `MergingResourceProvider` (only for reading)
* `CRUDMergingResourceProvider` (for reading and writing)

Those providers give access to virtual resources which provide a merged view on multiple other resources.

Each `MergedResourcePicker` service implementation in the system provides one unique mount point/root path (usually starting with `/mnt`) exposing a view on merged resources from at least two different locations. 

The exact merging mechanism depends on the resource picker implementation (see below). The order of the merging is important as the overlying resource may overwrite properties/child resources from the underlying resource (but not vice-versa). 
It is possible to

* remove existing resource/properties from the underlying resources,
* modify existing properties/child resources of the underlying resources and
* add new properties/child resources

You may use any of the merge properties described below to influence the merging behaviour. All those special properties are not exposed below the mount point. 

The `CRUDMergingResourceProvider` not only gives read-access to the merged resources but even allows to write. This provider always writes inside the topmost resource path (being returned as last item by the resource picker). Currently both resource pickers shipped with the Sling Resource Merger bundle do not allow to write though. Further details can be found in the description of [SLING-3909](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3909).


# Merge Properties

Property Name | Type | Description
------------- | ---- | ---------
sling:hideProperties | String[] | Hides the properties matching the given names. The exact syntax is described below.
sling:hideChildren| String[] | Hides the child resources with the given names.  The exact syntax is described below.
sling:hideResource | Boolean | If `true` then the resource with the name which contains this property should not be exposed!
sling:orderBefore | String | Contains the name of the preceding sibling resource. This is influencing the order of resources when calling e.g. `Resource.listChildren()` or `Resource.getChildren()` on the merged resource. This is only necessary if the default child resource order is not sufficient (see below).

## sling:hideProperties/hideChildren syntax
Both properties `sling:hideProperties` and `sling:hideChildren` take multiple string values which either act as allow list or as deny list.
They are treated as deny list if the first value is starting with an odd number of `!` otherwise as allow list. 

In case negated (odd number of leader `!` ) and non-negated values are mixed in one property the first one determines the list type, and all values of the other type are just skipped!

For deny lists an implicit wildcard is assumed, i.e. everything is allowed except for the names given in negated form. Giving an explicit wildcard (`*`) is optional and does not change the semantics.

Each value can either be `*` which is treated as wildcard (i.e. matches all names) or a string with no placeholders. That string is unescaped by removing half of the leading `!` characters. That allows to negate arbitrary item names (even ones starting with one or multiple `!`).

Escaped Value | Unescaped Value | Is negated
--- | --- | ---
!name | name | yes
name | name | no
!!name | !name | no
!!!name | !name | yes
!!!!name!test | !!name!test | no

The matching algorithm just compares the item name (either resource or property name) with each of the given unescaped values. It matches if at least one is equal from an allow list or none is equal from a deny list.
 
Since version 1.3.2 the wildcard only affects underlying child resources and no longer local ones, see also [SLING-5468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-5468).


# Child Resource Order

For a merged resource the order of its child resources is the following:
First the ones from the underlying resource, then the ones from the overlying resources.

In case the same child is defined in more than one resource, its position is taken from the highest overlaying resource (since version 1.3.2, see also [SLING-4915](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-4915), for some more examples for more complicated merges look at [SLING-6956](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-6956)).
For example:
    
    base/
    	+--child1
    	+--child3
    	+--child5
    	
    overlay/
    	+--child2
    	+--child3
    	+--child4
    	
    resulting order: child1, child5, child2, child3, child4

You can overwrite that behaviour by leveraging the `sling:orderBefore` property.

# Resource Type Handling

When resources are merged into a new resource, the resource type of the merged resource is set to the resource type of the last resource used for merging (see Resource Picks). 

The resource super type is set to the merged value of the 'sling:resourceType' property - if it exists and its value is not the same as the resource type.

In addition, the 'sling:resourceType' property in the returned value map is set to the resource type of the merged resource. Similar, the 'sling:resourceSuperType' property is set to the resource super type (if not null).

# Resource Pickers

## Merging Resource Picker (Overlay approach)

 Description | Merged Resource Path | Merging Order | Read-Only | Related Ticket 
------------ | -------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------
Merging based on the resource resolver's search path | `/mnt/overlay/<relative resource path>` | Last resource resolver search path first (Order = Descending search paths). | `true` |  [SLING-2986](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-2986) 

This picker is thought for globally overlaying content by placing the diff-resource in "/apps" without actually touching anything in "/libs" (since this is only thought for Sling itself). This should be used whenever some deviation of content is desired which is initially shipped with Sling. The client (i.e. the code using the merged resource) does not have to know if there is an overlay in place.
 

### Example

    /libs/sling/example (nt:folder)
         +-- sling:resourceType = "some/resource/type"
         +-- child1 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child1"
         +-- child2 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child2"
         +-- child3 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child3"
         
    
    /apps/sling/example (sling:Folder)
         +-- property1 = "property added in apps"
         +-- child1 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- sling:hideResource = true
         +-- child2 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child2"
         +-- child3 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property2 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child3"
    
    
    /mnt/overlay/sling/example (sling:Folder)
         +-- sling:resourceType = "some/resource/type"
         +-- property1 = "property added in apps"
         +-- child2 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child2"
         +-- child3 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child3"
         |   +-- property2 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child3"



## Overriding Resource Picker (Override approach)

Description | Merged Resource Path | Merging Order | Read-Only | Related Ticket
----------- | -------------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------
Merging based on the `sling:resourceSuperType` | `/mnt/override/<absolute resource type>` | The topmost resource type (having itself no `sling:resourceSuperType` defined) is the base. The resources are overlaid in the order from the most generic one to the most specific one (which is the one having the most inheritance levels). | `true` | [SLING-3675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3657)

This picker is thought for extending content of another already existing resource (which should not be modified). The client (i.e. the code using the merged resource) must directly reference the most specific resource type (i.e. it must be aware of the sub resource type).

### Example

    /apps/sling/base (nt:folder)
         +-- child1 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child1"
         +-- child2 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child2"
         +-- child3 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child3"
         
    
    /apps/sling/example (sling:Folder)
    	 +-- sling:resourceSuperType = "/apps/sling/base"
         +-- property1 = "property added in /apps/sling/example"
         +-- child1 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- sling:hideResource = true
         +-- child2 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child2"
         +-- child3 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property2 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child3"
    
    
    /mnt/override/apps/sling/example (sling:Folder)
         +-- sling:resourceSuperType = "/apps/sling/base"
         +-- property1 = "property added in /apps/sling/example"
         +-- child2 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child2"
         +-- child3 (nt:folder)
         |   +-- property1 = "property from /libs/sling/example/child3"
         |   +-- property2 = "property from /apps/sling/example/child3"
