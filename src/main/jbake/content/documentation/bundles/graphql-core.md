The [Sling GraphQL Core](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-graphql-core/) module 
allows for running GraphQL queries in Sling, using dynamically built GraphQL schemas and OSGi
services for data fetchers (aka "resolvers") which provide the data.

See the [o.a.s.graphql.core Git repository](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-graphql-core/)
for more information.

The [GraphQL Sample Website module](https://github.com/apache/sling-samples/tree/master/org.apache.sling.graphql.samples.website)
provides a complete sample which uses GraphQL queries (and Handlebars templates) on both the server and client sides,
to demonstrate the various modes that the GraphQL Core module supports.
