# How you can contribute

We're on the way to improve the documentation, but it's a long way. If you would like to contribute to the documentation you are very welcome. Please directly post your proposals to the [public wiki](http://cwiki.apache.org/SLING/) or post your suggestions to the [mailing list](/project-information.html).


# How the documentation is generated

The basic documentation of Sling is made up of four parts:

1. The Sling Site at http://sling.apache.org/ (you are here)
1. The Public Wiki at http://cwiki.apache.org/SLING
1. The JavaDoc
1. The Maven plugin documentation

This page is about how this documentation is maintained and who is allowed to do what.


## The Sling Website

The website is built from a dedicated repository as described [Project Information](/project-information.html#documentation-repository).


## The Public Wiki

The public wiki of Sling is available at [http://cwiki.apache.org/SLING](http://cwiki.apache.org/SLING) and is maintained in the Confluence space *SLING*. Everyone can create an account there. To gain edit rights please ask via the [mailing list](/project-information.html). Any of the administrators listed in the [Space Overview](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/spaces/viewspacesummary.action?key=SLING&showAllAdmins=true) can give you access.


## The JavaDoc

With every major release of Sling the JavaDoc of all containing bundles are published below [http://sling.apache.org/apidocs/](http://sling.apache.org/apidocs/).
The script for generating this aggregation JavaDoc is in the sling-tooling-release repo, at [generate_javadoc_for_release.sh](https://github.com/apache/sling-tooling-release/blob/master/generate_javadoc_for_release.sh).

In addition every released bundle is released together with its JavaDoc (which is also pushed to Maven Central).

## The Maven Plugin Documentation

For the most important Maven Plugins the according Maven Sites (generated with the `maven-site-plugin`) are published at [http://sling.apache.org/components/](http://sling.apache.org/components/). The description on how to publish can be found at [Release Management](/documentation/development/release-management.html).
