# History

Sling started as an internal project at [Day Software](http://www.day.com)
, and entered the Apache Incubator in September 2007. As of June, 17th,
2009 Apache Sling is a top level project of the Apache Software Foundation.

The name "Sling" has been proposed by Roy Fielding who explained it like
this:

> \[The name is\] Biblical in nature.  The story of David: the weapon he
> uses to slay the giant Goliath is a sling.  Hence, our David's
> \[David Nuescheler, CTO of Day Software\] favorite weapon.

> It is also the simplest device for delivering content very fast.
