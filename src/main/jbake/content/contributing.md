Thanks for choosing to contribute to Apache Sling! The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Code of Conduct

Being an Apache project, Apache Sling adheres to the Apache Software Foundation's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

## Legal

Before submitting anything to the project, whether we are talking about code, documentation or even website changes, please make sure you
understand the [legal side of things](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/legal.html).

## How to contribute

Apache Sling is a volunteer effort, so there is always plenty of work that needs to be accomplished. If you want to help supporting Sling,
this page is intended as a starting point for specific contribution ideas. To further understand how the Sling community operates, refer to
the [Community Roles and Processes document](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html) and/or join the mailing lists.

See [Project Information](/project-information.html) for details about the tools mentioned below.

The Apache Sling project organizes its "to do" list using the JIRA issue tracking system. No matter if you are a programmer or not, it is
probably best to check JIRA first to figure out if the problem you identified is already known or not. If not, please create a JIRA issue in
which you try to describe to the best of your knowledge the bug that you want to fix or the improvement that you would like to contribute.

If pull requests are familiar to you, the next step would be opening one against one of the project's modules. More details about how the
project is structured in terms of repositories can be read on the
[Getting and Building Sling](/documentation/development/getting-and-building-sling.html) page.

For relatively large contributions (e.g. new modules), we recommend either one of the following two approaches:

1. open a JIRA issue and send a pull request to the [Apache Sling Whiteboard project](https://github.com/apache/sling-whiteboard/)
2. open a JIRA issue and attach your source code as an archive to it

For people who are completely new to contributing to an Apache Software Foundation project, the
[Get Involved](https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html) page provides you with enough resources to understand how the foundation
works and how its projects are structured.
