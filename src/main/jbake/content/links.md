## Technology used by Sling

### JSR 170 - Content Repository for Java{tm} technology API

The specification of the repository API: [JSR 170: Content Repository for Java{tm} technology API](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170).

### Apache Jackrabbit

The main purpose of Sling is to develop a content-centric Web Application
 framework for Java Content Repository (JCR) based data stores. Sling is
 implemented - with the notable exception of JCR Node Type management -
 purely in terms of the JCR API and as such may use any JCR compliant
 repository. The default implementation for [Apache Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org)
 is provided out of the box. This is also the reference implementation
 of the Content Repository for Java (JCR) Specification.
 
### The OSGi Alliance

[The OSGi Alliance](http://www.osgi.org) is the specification body defining the OSGi specifications,
 namely the Core, Compendium, Enterprise and IoT specifications. These specifications are at the
 center of making Sling possible. Sling is implemented as a series of OSGi modules (called bundles)
 and makes extensive use of the OSGi functionality, such as lifecycle management and the service 
 layer. In addition, Sling requires several OSGi compendium services to be available, such as the 
 Log Service, Http Service, Configuration Admin Service, Metatype Service, and
 Declarative Services.

### Apache Felix

While Sling does not require a specific OSGi framework implementation to
 run in, Sling is being developed using [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org)
 as the OSGi framework implementation. It has not been tested yet, but it
 is expected that Sling also operates perfectly inside other OSGi frameworks
 such as [Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox) and [Knopflerfish](http://www.knopflerfish.org).
